# ClipMoveAI-Text2Video

ClipMove AI's Text to video backend pipeline

This pipeline requires at least 10GB VRAM, and is used for the backend services at https://www.clipmove.com

## Description

The ClipMoveAI-Text2Video pipeline is a powerful tool that converts text input into high-quality video output. It leverages advanced machine learning models including Google Researches Interpolation model and Stable Video Diffusion.

## Features

- **Text-to-Video Conversion**: The pipeline takes textual input, such as descriptions, scripts, or narratives, and generates corresponding video content.
- **High-Quality Video Generation**: Utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning models for interpolation, the pipeline produces visually stunning and realistic videos with smooth motion and detailed scenes.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust various parameters to control the output, such as video resolution, frame rate, and style preferences.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: The pipeline is designed to handle large-scale video generation tasks efficiently with several GPU workers and supports multi-GPU instances, making it suitable for various applications and use cases.

## Requirements

- **VRAM**: The pipeline requires at least 10GB of VRAM (Video RAM) to run effectively. Ensure that your system meets this requirement before running the pipeline.
- **Dependencies**: The necessary dependencies and libraries will be listed in the project's documentation or installation
